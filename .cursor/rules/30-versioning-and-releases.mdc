## Version sources (keep aligned on releases)

- Package version is defined in: `projects/adapter/pyproject.toml`
- Adapter runtime versions are defined in:
  - `projects/adapter/src/dbt/adapters/fal/__version__.py`
  - `projects/adapter/src/dbt/adapters/fal_experimental/__version__.py`

If you bump versions for a release, update **all of the above** (and keep them consistent).

## Compatibility guardrails

- `projects/adapter/pyproject.toml` pins dbt compatibility (e.g. `dbt-core` range). Don’t widen/narrow those constraints without:
  - checking dbt’s adapter interface changes for that range
  - running integration tests
  - updating docs

## Changelog tooling

- This repo uses `cliff.toml` (git-cliff). If you’re preparing a release, follow the existing commit/changelog conventions instead of hand-editing a changelog.
